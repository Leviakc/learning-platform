```python
# Time to practice! Your goal is to create two variables and print them.

# 1.  Create a variable named `city` and assign it the string value `"New York"`.
# 2.  Create a variable named `temperature` and assign it the float value `72.5`.
# 3.  Use the `print()` function to display the value of each variable.
```

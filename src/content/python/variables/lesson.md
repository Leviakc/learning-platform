A **variable** is like a labeled box where you can store information. You create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it.

In Python, data comes in several types:

- **String (str):** Used for text. You create them with quotes.
  `"Hello, World!"`
- **Integer (int):** Used for whole numbers.
  `10`, `-5`, `123`
- **Float (float):** Used for numbers with a decimal point.
  `3.14`, `99.9`

Here's how you create a variable and assign a value to it:

```python

name = "Alice"  # A string variable
age = 30       # An integer variable


```
